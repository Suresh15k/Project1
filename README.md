The goal is to understand the interaction between the customers and the ecommerce portal so that we can find insights to improve the stakeholder benefits. Example like understand the customer requirements & target products to specific markets, optimize the inventory based on sales, improve the profitability by targeting relevant customers.   

## Process
### Import the existing data from the source
### Clean the data using querry tools 
### create a ERD by analizing the relations between the entities 
### Find insigts from the clean data to understand the process 

## Results
I was able to inderstand that the maximum sale happend through Page compared to events. I do understand that most of the orders happend in one country "US" and a very little in spain. 

## Challenges 
The data had lots of duplicates value, Null values, Redundant Values, Type changes, Format change making it difficult to clean and evaluate 

## Future Goals
I have to do much more cleaning of the data and try to create a relational database.
